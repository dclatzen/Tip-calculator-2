## Notes
Challenges:

I ran into a recurring error "Thread 1: signal SIGABRT" which pretty much drove me crazy until I found a Youtube video addressing it. So that was good. 

I kept wishing I knew more of the syntax, like missing words in a vocabulary. I wanted the command for "Make this text field automaticaly have focus." But I didn't know how to write that in code. I also wanted to change the color of elements, but that wasn't as straightforward as editing a hex value. Took a lot of time to figure out the syntax for things I take for granted in other contexts.

It was also hard to figure out what the Readme was asking for in the "Video Walkthrough" section. The tutorial showed us how to embed a gif, but the "href" in the Readme template seemed to be asking for an image held in a mythical "course_images" directory. That threw me because I didn't find any instructions for how to upload my gif to that directory. I eventually decided to embed it and hope for the best.

I'm planning to add more elegant animations, with a larger "subtotal" initial screen, along with a "split" option.

Thanks!
